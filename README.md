# PixelBreaker


This is a mobile application used to read the electric meters. The user just takes an image of his electric meter and the image is sent to the backend to process the image, extract the reading and save this reading to the database. There are two types of users for this application, the one responsible for collecting the readings (assigned by the government) and the normal user the one who is being charged for his electric usage.
This application is implemnted in ionic as the front end, and the backend is in python. The backend uses django as a framework for handling the different views and managing the database. Also opencv library was used for the image processing part.
